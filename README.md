# Development Process
  This project was my first experince creating a full-stack website, with a backend and front end built by myself.
  I was able to take a lot of my learning and relfecltions from my past project (a tic tac toe game), and use it
  to help create and improve this website.

  As this was my first time building something like this from the ground up, my primary goal was to make sure
  the calls to my api, the api itself, and the database were running correctly, before I even though about touching my
  front end. This was a big lesson learned from my last project, where I focused on the front-end first, but was
  struggling when I then decided to connect it to the back-end after. After having been able to CRUD my database,
  I then began to build out my jquery and api calls on my front end. I hit a few road blocks, mainly when implementing handlebars, to help with preventing XSS, and when working on my update/patch requests. I knew going in
  that these two would cause the most trouble, but with the help of documentation, intructor guidance, and reviewing
  past tickets from prior engineers, I was able to move past these two issues. Once I finally was able to CRUD through the front end, my final goal was to work on making sure the proper messaging appear for the users, and then creating the CSS for the site.

  As my web page progressed and problems were encountered, I found that utilizing past issues, in the project's issue cue, google, and even just stepping back and writing/ pseudocoding it out, helped me push through many of the problems. When I did encounter issues that I was unable to progress past, even with research and planning, I would then work with the instructors and issue cue to help get past the hurdle, and in turn gain new knowledge on how to solve the problem.

### Reflections
  Looking back on the project, I am able to take away several reflections and learnings that I believe will help me with my future endeavors.

  - Using handlebars allowed me to implent a clean and organized way to present the database content to the user. Having seen the power of these templates, but also seeing the struggle I encounted when first setting it up, has led me to want to learn more and practice more on using handlebars, as I believe they can help create a more cohesive, clean and modular website.

  - I found that I hit a big road block when it came to the upate feature on my front-end website. I was able to push past it, but this is something I now know I need to continue to work and practice with, as once I begin to make many table, or many database applications, I will need to have this skill in my back pocket.

  - I have seen a large improvement on my comfort, understanding, and coding skill since my last project. I know that the learning path is never ending, but I am proud of the improvements on my abilities since last project.

 # Future Goals

  As I continue to work on and update this project, I have the below goals I would like to accomplish:

  - Refactoring code to produce more DRY code, and reduce repeition
  - Working on improving modularity, and the usage of handlebars
  - Improving the mobile design of the site, to allow better use on smaller screens
  - Implement a way to allow users to add other user to their game, as players
  - Implement a way to allow users to express interest in upcoming games
  - Implement a way to allow users to send form emails to users who will be running games
  - Implement a way to allow users to make sessions logs for their games, as to be able to provide a reference for other players, themselves, and for anyone to read and enjoy

# Project User Stories and Wireframes

- As a user, I want to create a game
- As a user, I want to view all my games
- As a user, I want to view all games
- As a user, I want to delete game
- As a user, I want to be able to update any of my added games
- As a user, I want to see what date a game is starting
